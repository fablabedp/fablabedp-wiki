## Setting the Nozzle Height

*I found this to be the easiest way to calibrate the nozzle height of both extruders:*

1. Disable the motors and move the extruder to the center of the build plate.  
2. Remove the cooling fans for each extruder.

3. Heat both extruders to 180°C.
4. Home the Z position.
5. Adjust Z until there is a snug fit with 0.2mm metal shim between nozzle and build plate.
6. Select the other extruder (Select L or R and then Extrude down or up to activate the extruder)
7. Loosen the nozzle retaining screw and adjust the nozzle height until the 0.2mm shim is also snug with this nozzle.

  You may have to adjust the Z position if there is not enough clearance available between the nozzle and the extruder to find the correct height.  After adjusting the Z position, repeat the process again with the other nozzle.  
  Both nozzles should now be at the same height.
8. Adjust the Z home screw (remove the hotglue if in place) - After moving home, then moving 0.2mm down, the 0.2mm shim should be a snug fit between the nozzle and the build plate. The screw position is very sensitive.

9. Put hotglue between the Z home screw head and body, to hold it in place and prevent accidental adjustments.
