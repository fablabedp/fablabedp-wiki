###### tags: `workshop` `microbit`

0. Introductions, intro to FabLab EDP

1. Intro to microbit: What is it, what can it do, and what is it good for?
	> Open-source embedded development platform, launched by the BBC in the UK in 2015 for getting kids into programming, in the spirit of the BBC Micro computer of the 1980s.  
	> Around 1M microbits were donated to UK school children by the BBC.

2. Example 1a. Balanço
	> https://makecode.microbit.org/_85cPVh2DVdWK  
	> Simple overview of MakeCode  
	> Use chrome in order to use webUSB to flash the microbit directly  
	> Input using accelerometer  
	> Output to LED matrix  
	> Basic logic  

3. Example 1b. Balanço Programável
	> https://makecode.microbit.org/_M7YDted9f3wE  
	> Input using buttons  
	> Use of variables  

4. Technical overview of the microbit hardware.
	> How is it different to Arduino? Raspberry Pi?  
	> What is MicroPython? What is the advantage over programming in Arduino?  
	> The Microbit Python editor. Also, what is the REPL? https://python.microbit.org/v/2  
	> Compare with Adafruit Circuit Playground: https://www.adafruit.com/product/3333, https://makecode.adafruit.com/ (CircuitPython instead of MicroPython)  
	> What is MakeCode?  Blocks based visual programming tool for education, developed by microsoft and inspired by MIT Scratch and other similar tools. Began as Microsoft Programming Experience Toolkit (PXT). www.makecode.com  
	> Makecode can also be used with other hardware platforms: https://maker.makecode.com/  

5. Example 2. Air Piano
	> https://makecode.microbit.org/_gFqhxWJp7KHW  
	> Playing tones  
	> Using LEDs and light sensor  
	> Mapping light values to tone frequencies  
	> Using light values to pick predefined tones from an array  

6. Example 3. Tennis
	> https://makecode.microbit.org/_Vjx9CCWVRPe8  
	> Radio send and receive  
	> Using a variable to manage states  

7. Sharing projects and Git integration
	> MakeCode does not require a login to use, but you can associate your session with a github account  
	> Read-only browser for projects with github repositories https://makecode.com/github-explorer  

8. Review some suppliers and resources for teachers
	> Microbit classroom: https://classroom.microbit.org
