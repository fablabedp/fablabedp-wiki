Carrying cases designed for transporting collections of oil samples taken from power transformers, for the Labelec  Insulating Materials Laboratory.

The case was modelled in Solidworks using sheet metal tools, and then imported into Rhino for CAM.  The design includes tabs that allow for easy stacking of the cases.

The case was milled from 4mm Alucobond, mostly with a 5mm end mill but with some 3mm end mill pockets for the sharper corners around the tabs.  The bends were engraved with a 90Â° v-cutter.

Graphics were laser-engraved after milling the parts.  The internal cavities were machined from 53mm layers of EPS, that were glued together and then coated with a silicone paint.  The cases were rapidly assembled with 4mm rivets, and use a small aluminium tube together with the rivets to re-enforce the center of the case and hold the top panel in place.  The design also includes a lasercut PET label holster.
