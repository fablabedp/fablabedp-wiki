The internal structure is made from 19mm expanded PVC, and the external housing from 4mm brushed aluminium alupanel.  Both were CNC machined.

The base is laser-cut from a sheet of 3mm stainless steel with brushed finish, with felt pads underneath.  The seam of the folded alupanel housing is closed with white a PVC profile.
