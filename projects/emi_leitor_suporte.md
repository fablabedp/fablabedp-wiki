Reproduction of an out-of-production bracket for mounting optical meter readings sensors on electricity meters, for EDP Labelec Qualifications and Inspections.  Designed to accomodate specifically the Zera TK326 and TMI SH 2003 scanning heads.

 - 3D printed spring mechanisms that simulated the internal compression springs in the original parts, used for locking the laterally and vertically sliding parts in place.
 - Telescoping aluminium extrusions, with internal tension springs. The springs are attached by removing the loop ends and twisting onto the screw threads. Some 3D printed spacers are used to center the screws in the ends of the outer tube.  
 - Main parts printed in PLA, side panels cut in acrylic and feet printed in TPU.  
 - The TMI sensor is mounted on two 3mm carbon fibre rods, whilst the Zera sensor is attached using an extra adapter part.
