## Cleaning everything above the water level

After doing some cutting there will be abrasive everywhere. the easiest way to clean it off is to leave the lid open a nd let it dry, then to brush/vacuum it off.

## Emptying the used abrasive buckets
https://www.wazer.com/how-to-videos/empty-used-abrasive-buckets

Should be emptied before every new cut.


## Cleaning Drain Filters

It is recommended to clean the Drain Filter after every cut job.

Pull on fixture to remove each filter - dunk the filter in water (can use used abrasive buckets) - then rinse in sink.

## Tank Cleaning Cycle

Abrasive will normallly accumulate in the bottom of the tank.  there is a cleaning cycle that moves the toolhead along a predefined pattern to push abrasive towards the corners of the tank so that it can be collected by the pickup filters

It is recommended running this cycle before cutting if your machine has been sitting for a long time with abrasive in the bottom.
Requires that there is a certain amount of abrasive accumulated in the tank, otherwise it will not have any effect.

## Cleaning the filtration system and collecting used abrasive

Should follow these steps if the filtration system does not seem to be collecting used abrasive at a normal rate.

`Setup & Maintenance > Maintenance > Used Abr. Collect`
 - Will run the low pressure pumps.
 - To try to clear a blockage, plug the outlet holes with your fingers for about 10s, once you release the water should become murkier.  repeat several times on one side and then the other.

`Setup & Maintenance > Maintenance > Abrasive Pickup cleaning`
- Will attempt to clear blockages around the pickup filters in the corners of the tank (uses a motion routine?)

## Full tank cleaning

https://www.wazer.com/resources/maintenance/procedures/rear-baffle-quick-check
Rear Baffle blockage - this can cause the water level around the filters to drop relative to the level in the tank when running the low pressure pumps ("Used Abr. Collect") .  A full tank clean is needed to clear the blockage.


# Pressure Lines

## Nozzle Purge
https://www.wazer.com/resources/maintenance/procedures/nozzle-purge

depressurize the high-pressure system - if the wazer was shutdown or turned off before completing a cut you must purge the high pressure system
`Setup & Maintenance > Maintenance > Nozzle Purge`

> if a job finishes normally or is paused/cancelled normally then it should automatically purge?

## Maintenance on High Pressure line

Before detaching the high pressure tube, always open the HP valve to release any residual pressure
`Setup & Maintenance > Input and output check> output check > HP Valve`
