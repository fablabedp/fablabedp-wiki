# Workshop Inkscape and Laser Cutting

###### tags: `workshop` `inkscape` `laser`

0. Introductions, FabLab

1. What is vector drawing? Comparison with Raster.

2. Introduction to Inkscape:
	1. Open example file 1: `icon_fablabedp_cor.svg`
	 - Navigation
	 - Selecting and manipulating objects, working with groups
	 - Ordering objects
	 - Changing fill and stroke properties
	 - Using different display modes to view outlines
	2. Open example file 2: `icon_fablabedp_preto-branco.svg`
	 - See how this version has a "clean" shape, where the outlines correspond to the visual form.
	 - Define drawing dimensions
	 - Identify islands in the shape and make bridges accordingly using boolean operations
	 - Decide which lines to cut and which to engrave
	 - Add additional geometry depending on our use case, using snaps and align tools to position objects

3. Start to create:
	- Go to thenounproject.com, make an account and download some art.
		+ Consider which lines you would like to cut and which to engrave.
	- and/or, go to dafont.com and choose a font to work with some text.
		+ For cutting out text, consider stencil fonts (for negtative cuts) or script fonts (for positive cuts).
		+ After installing a new font, you will need to restart Inkscape to use it.
