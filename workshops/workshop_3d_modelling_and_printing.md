## Part 1: Introduction to Tinkercad

1. Use Chrome or Edge to access www.tinkercad.com.  Create an autodesk account (login > sign up > create a personal account).
2. Create a new 3D Design, place a cube on the workplane.

## Part 2: Customise your vessel

1. Start with a ruler roughly centered on the default workplane in midpoint mode.
2. Use a series of cylinders and cones or paraboloids to make the neck and spout of our part.
3. Make a handle:
	- If using some kind of rod as a handle, create a fitting for this using another group of cylinders, spaced roughly distant enough to make a comfortable handle.
	- If printing a small handle, build this out of cylinders, boxes or spheres as you see fit.  Note that the handle will extend below the workplane.
4. Using a pair of boxes, create a bridge with a slot joining the two parts.
5. Add one or two 5.3mm holes in the bridge for fastening the part with a screw.
6. Export your finished part as an STL file.
