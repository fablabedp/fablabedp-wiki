## How to setup Modela Player

[Do not use modela player for PCB]

Modela has a dedicated software for the Roland Modela MDX-20 in which you have access to the materials available and you can define your tool arsenal.
The software also allows you to prepare your model to be machined.
Step 1: Open Modela Player

Step 2: Select the machine

Go to [File] and click on [Select machine...] to appear a new window 

Define the following:

Model name: MDX-20

Command set: RML-1

Spindle Unit: Standard

Printer Name: Find "Roland MODELA MDX-20"

Step 3: Go to [File] and select [Open]

It will open a File Explorer window in which you will select the model to input in the player.
Modela Player allows the following formats: .mpj, .dxf, .igs, .mdj .

Step 4: Go to [Set] and select [Model]

It is now necessary to define the model orientation and  its origin.

In the Size and Orientation tap make sure of the following:

Model Size: Length

Check if the model dimensions are accurate and keep the ratio.

If the model wasnâ€™t modeled in the way that respects the coordinates, make use of the Orientation area to define the top surface by clicking on the dot that shows the right position in relation to the X/Y axis.

Go to the [Origin] tab

You can see that in a simple and clear way it allows to select the model origin just by clicking the dot , to define the origin.

It is recommended to select the lower left corner.

Click [Ok]

Step 5: Make sure that the tools needed for the job are defined in the [Add/Remove Tool] option.

If the tools selected for the task aren't already in the library please insert them as specified below:

-Go to [Options] and select [Add/Remove Tool] a window will pop up.

-Select [New].

A new tool slot will appear allowing to select the parameters according to the specs of the tool.

-Give your tool a name keeping the following pattern: *tool diameter* *type of tool tip* eg: 1mm Square

-Define the tool material.

Typically the material is HSS (High Speed Steel).

The CC (cemented carbide) is usually a special material and more expensive.

- Set the flute diameter. 

- Click on [Cutting Parameters...]

- Select the material through clicking on the list in front of the material.

- Click on [Set Parameters]

- Double check the cutting parameters and feel free to adjust according to the material of choice.
  It is recommended to leave them asdefault.

- Officialize the parameters by clicking on "Register" 
  Now your tool is ready to use?

Step 6: Defining a new process

This will allow you to choose the order and which processes you would like to make.
It is strongly recommended to respect the following order: Surfacing -> Roughing -> Drilling* -> Finishing**

* -The rilling depends on the part it can be ignored if not needed.
  ** - It is recommended to make a finishing process only after the part as been machined to that stage. 

Select the New process button with a ladder figure.

A window will appear with the following options:

o Surfacing

o Roughing

o Finishing

o Drilling

As the processes is very similar, setup-wise the following will be a generic followthrough in that new window.

- Choose the type of process

- Select the cutting surface

- Choose the tool for the process

- Select the area and depth 

- Choose the type of tool path to create

- Select the cutting parameters

- Enter a name for the process
